The Polygon Mesh Processing Library is a modern C++ open-source library for processing and visualizing polygon surface meshes. Its main features are:

- An efficient and easy-to-use mesh data structure
- Standard algorithms such as decimation, remeshing, subdivision, or smoothing
- Ready-to-use visualization tools
- Seamless cross-compilation to JavaScript ([demo](https://www.pmp-library.org/demos/mpview.html))

## Get Started

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pmp-library/pmp-library.git
```

Configure and build:

```sh
cd pmp-library && mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make
```

Run the mesh processing app:

```sh
./mpview ../data/off/bunny.off
```

Build your own tool:

```cpp
#include <pmp/surface_mesh.h>
#include <pmp/io/io.h>

int main()
{
    pmp::SurfaceMesh mesh;
    pmp::read(mesh,"input.obj");
    // .. do awesome things with your mesh
    pmp::write(mesh,"output.obj");
}
```

## Read the Docs

The [user guide](https://www.pmp-library.org/guide.html) contains all you need to get started using PMP, including a [tutorial](https://www.pmp-library.org/tutorial.html) covering mesh processing basics.

## Contribute
